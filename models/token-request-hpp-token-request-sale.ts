By including a common GroupId for two or more Sales transaction, a Virtual Card may then be created for the sum of the Sales within that GroupId.  A common use case for this is when multiple families are going on a cruise - each family may want to pay separately on their credit card. However, the Travel Agent may want to pay for the cruise with one virtual card.  The maximum length is 25 alpha-numeric characters.  This is for limited use - please contact your Customer Success Manager if you would like to enable this functionality.
